Kiui's notebook: A collection of random computer knowledge.

It works like a cheat sheet for whatever I have learnt, and hopefully it can help.

The contents are based on personal understanding and may be wrong, please take it with a grain of salt :-)

Feel free to open an issue for any discussion!

### If you want to build your own note

All notes are in markdown format, and kept under `docs`.

I use [typora](https://typora.io/) for local editing, and periodically sync it to github.
The website is automatically deployed with [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) after each sync (with [this simple script](sync.ps1) on Windows), you can find the related note [here](https://note.kiui.moe/python/mkdocs/).
