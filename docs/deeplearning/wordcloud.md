Parameters
    ----------
    font_path : string
        Font path to the font that will be used (OTF or TTF).
        Defaults to DroidSansMono path on a Linux machine. If you are on
        another OS or don't have this font, you need to adjust this path.
    width : int (default=400)
        Width of the canvas.
    height : int (default=200)
        Height of the canvas.
    prefer_horizontal : float (default=0.90)
        The ratio of times to try horizontal fitting as opposed to vertical.
        If prefer_horizontal < 1, the algorithm will try rotating the word
        if it doesn't fit. (There is currently no built-in way to get only
        vertical words.)
    mask : nd-array or None (default=None)
        If not None, gives a binary mask on where to draw words. If mask is not
        None, width and height will be ignored and the shape of mask will be
        used instead. All white (#FF or #FFFFFF) entries will be considerd
        "masked out" while other entries will be free to draw on. [This
        changed in the most recent version!]
    contour_width: float (default=0)
        If mask is not None and contour_width > 0, draw the mask contour.
    contour_color: color value (default="black")
        Mask contour color.
    scale : float (default=1)
        Scaling between computation and drawing. For large word-cloud images,
        using scale instead of larger canvas size is significantly faster, but
        might lead to a coarser fit for the words.
    min_font_size : int (default=4)
        Smallest font size to use. Will stop when there is no more room in this
        size.
    font_step : int (default=1)
        Step size for the font. font_step > 1 might speed up computation but
        give a worse fit.
    max_words : number (default=200)
        The maximum number of words.
    stopwords : set of strings or None
        The words that will be eliminated. If None, the build-in STOPWORDS
        list will be used. Ignored if using generate_from_frequencies.
    background_color : color value (default="black")
        Background color for the word cloud image.
    max_font_size : int or None (default=None)
        Maximum font size for the largest word. If None, height of the image is
        used.
    mode : string (default="RGB")
        Transparent background will be generated when mode is "RGBA" and
        background_color is None.
    relative_scaling : float (default='auto')
        Importance of relative word frequencies for font-size.  With
        relative_scaling=0, only word-ranks are considered.  With
        relative_scaling=1, a word that is twice as frequent will have twice
        the size.  If you want to consider the word frequencies and not only
        their rank, relative_scaling around .5 often looks good.
        If 'auto' it will be set to 0.5 unless repeat is true, in which
        case it will be set to 0.
        .. versionchanged: 2.0
            Default is now 'auto'.
    color_func : callable, default=None
        Callable with parameters word, font_size, position, orientation,
        font_path, random_state that returns a PIL color for each word.
        Overwrites "colormap".
        See colormap for specifying a matplotlib colormap instead.
        To create a word cloud with a single color, use
        ``color_func=lambda *args, **kwargs: "white"``.
        The single color can also be specified using RGB code. For example
        ``color_func=lambda *args, **kwargs: (255,0,0)`` sets color to red.
    regexp : string or None (optional)
        Regular expression to split the input text into tokens in process_text.
        If None is specified, ``r"\w[\w']+"`` is used. Ignored if using
        generate_from_frequencies.
    collocations : bool, default=True
        Whether to include collocations (bigrams) of two words. Ignored if using
        generate_from_frequencies.
        .. versionadded: 2.0
    colormap : string or matplotlib colormap, default="viridis"
        Matplotlib colormap to randomly draw colors from for each word.
        Ignored if "color_func" is specified.
        .. versionadded: 2.0
    normalize_plurals : bool, default=True
        Whether to remove trailing 's' from words. If True and a word
        appears with and without a trailing 's', the one with trailing 's'
        is removed and its counts are added to the version without
        trailing 's' -- unless the word ends with 'ss'. Ignored if using
        generate_from_frequencies.
    repeat : bool, default=False
        Whether to repeat words and phrases until max_words or min_font_size
        is reached.
    include_numbers : bool, default=False
        Whether to include numbers as phrases or not.
    min_word_length : int, default=0
        Minimum number of letters a word must have to be included.
    collocation_threshold: int, default=30
        Bigrams must have a Dunning likelihood collocation score greater than this
        parameter to be counted as bigrams. Default of 30 is arbitrary.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ``words_`` : dict of string to float
        Word tokens with associated frequency.
        .. versionchanged: 2.0
            ``words_`` is now a dictionary
    ``layout_`` : list of tuples (string, int, (int, int), int, color))
        Encodes the fitted word cloud. Encodes for each word the string, font
        size, position, orientation and color.
