### Basics

* Input
  * add Chinese input: settings --> text input --> edit --> +
  * change input method: `control + space`, or just `globe`
* `delete` is like `backspace` in Windows, use `globe + delete` to delete backwards.
* `command` is 90% like `control` in Windows!
  * `globe` is at the position of Windows `control`, but it's more like Windows `fn` and has no use in most cases.
  * remap `globe` and `command`: settings --> keyboard --> keyboard shortcuts --> modifier keys
  * `command + c/v` for copy/paste, but `control + c` for interruption in shell.
* `command + space`: spotlight search (useful to launch other apps)
* 3-finger-swipe-up: show all windows and change front app!
* dock and application status
  * a black dot underneath means **running in background**. It happens when you click left-top-"x". Use `command + q` to fully exit.
  * left-top-“-” will minimize the window to the right part of the dock, this will put the app in hibernation. Don't use it, instead use 3-finger-swipe-up.
  * dock can be hidden from settings.
* finder
  * cannot create a new file directly, instead open the corresponding app and save to file.
  * turn on actual path: finder --> view --> show path bar
  * **show hidden files & folders**: `command + shift + .`
  * `command + x` is not Cut, instead use `command + c` to Copy and `command + shift + v` to Move (instead of Paste).
  * `command + delete` to delete a file (move to trash).
