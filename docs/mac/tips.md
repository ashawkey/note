### Convenient things

* add Chinese input: settings --> text input --> edit --> +
* command is "control" in Windows!
  * globe key is at the position of Windows "control", but it's more like Windows "alt" and has no use in most cases.
  * remap globe and command: settings --> keyboard --> keyboard shortcuts --> modifier keys
* control + space: change input method
* command + space: spotlight search (useful to launch other apps)
* 3 fingers swipe up: show all windows!
* dock and application status
  * a black dot underneath means **running in background**. It happens when you click left-top-"x". Use command + Q to fully exit.
  * left-top-“-” will minimize the window to the right part of the dock, this will put the app in hibernation. Don't use it.
  * dock can be hidden from settings.

* split screen: buy magnet from app store...
